# 📊 Nykaa Sales Analysis (Synthetic Case Study)

This project is a **business analytics case study** built on a **synthetic dataset** that simulates Nykaa’s sales transactions.  
⚠️ *Note: The dataset is not sourced from Nykaa’s actual systems. It is generated to mimic real-world e-commerce data in structure, scale, and complexity.*  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **raw transactional data** can be transformed into **actionable insights** and **interactive dashboards** for business decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Understand Sales Performance** – Analyze revenue, units sold, and customer purchasing patterns.  
2. **Identify Growth Drivers** – Find top categories, brands, and products contributing to sales.  
3. **Uncover Trends** – Highlight seasonality, monthly cycles, and time-based behaviors.  
4. **Build Dashboards** – Provide interactive tools for management to explore insights.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `nykaa_raw.xlsx` → Unprocessed synthetic dataset (raw transactions).  
- `nykaa_clean_final.xlsx` → Cleaned dataset (missing values handled, formats standardized).  
- `nykaapythoneda.ipynb` → Python notebook for **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** and visualizations.  
- `nykaawithdasboard.xlsx` → Excel dashboard with KPI summaries.  
- `NykaaBI.pbix` / `bitut.pbix` → Power BI dashboards (final interactive report).
